Begin by heating butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add finely chopped onions and minced garlic to the pot, and cook until they're soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Next, add Arborio rice to the pot and cook, stirring constantly, until the grains are coated with the butter and begin to toast slightly. Pour in a splash of white wine and cook until it's absorbed. From there, gradually add hot chicken or vegetable broth to the rice, stirring frequently, until the risotto is creamy and the rice is tender with a slight bite.</div>"]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["<h2>reference:</h2> <div style='white-space: pre-wrap; width: 800px; overflow-x: auto;'>Preparing risotto entails sautéing onions and garlic, toasting Arborio rice, adding wine and broth gradually, and stirring until creamy and tender.</div>"]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["<h2>response:</h2> <div style='white-space: pre-wrap; width: 800px; overflow-x: auto;'>## Risotto Recipe Summary:\n","\n","This summary outlines the key steps involved in making a delicious risotto:\n","\n","**Ingredients:**\n","\n","* Butter\n","* Finely chopped onions\n","* Minced garlic\n","* Arborio rice\n","* White wine\n","* Hot chicken or vegetable broth\n","\n","**Instructions:**\n","\n","1. **Sauté aromatics:** Heat butter in a large pot and sauté onions and garlic until softened.\n","2. **Toast rice:** Add Arborio rice and stir until coated and slightly toasted.\n","3. **Deglaze with wine:** Pour in white wine and cook until absorbed.\n","4. **Gradually add broth:**</div>"]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["<h2>fluency/explanation:</h2> <div style='white-space: pre-wrap; width: 800px; overflow-x: auto;'>STEP 1: Assess grammar correctness: The response has minor grammatical errors, such as an incomplete sentence in the last step of the instructions.
