Additionally, the Hugging Face DLCs for TGI also capture the `AIP_` environment variables from Vertex AI as in [Vertex AI Documentation - Custom container requirements for prediction](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements).\n",

        "    * `MAX_INPUT_TOKENS` is the maximum allowed input length (expressed in number of tokens), the larger it is, the larger the prompt can be, but also more memory will be consumed.\n",
        "    * `MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS` is the most important value to set as it defines the \"memory budget\" of running clients requests, the larger this value, the larger amount each request will be in your RAM and the less effective batching can be.\n",
        "    * `MAX_BATCH_PREFILL_TOKENS` limits the number of tokens for the prefill operation, as it takes the most memory and is compute bound, it is interesting to limit the number of requests that can be sent.\n",

These neural networks are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain, where the data is processed in a hierarchical manner. Each layer of the neural network learns to represent the data in a more abstract and meaningful way, allowing the network to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data. This makes Deep Learning particularly well-suited for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making. Some common applications of Deep Learning include computer vision, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. <end_of_turn>\n",
